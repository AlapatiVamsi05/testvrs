## üõ†Ô∏è Software Requirements

To use VRS on your system, make sure you have the following:

1. **MongoDB Compass**
2. **Node.js**
3. A web browser (preferably **Google Chrome**)

---

## üìÇ Setting Up VRS on Your System

1. Create a folder to store the VRS project.
2. Inside this folder, save:
   - `assets/` folder
   - `frontend/` folder
   - `backend/server.js` (create a `backend` folder and place `server.js` inside it)
3. In MongoDB Compass:
   - Create a **connection** named `venues`.
   - Under this connection, create **three databases**:
     - `vTenali1`
     - `vGuntur1`
     - `vVijaya1`
   - For each database, create a **collection** with the same name.
4. Import the relevant JSON files (from the `mongodbcollections` folder) into their respective collections.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running VRS

1. Install the following Node.js packages (run this command inside your project folder):

   ```bash
   npm install express mongodb cors

2. After installation, a node_modules folder will be created automatically. Make sure this folder is in the same directory as your server.js file (typically the backend folder).
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project folder.
4. Run the server with:

   ```bash
   node backend/server.js
   ```

5. Ensure MongoDB is running in the background. You can start it with:

   ```bash
   net start mongodb
   ```
   Execute in cmd while running it as a administrator.

6. Navigate to the `frontend/homepage.html` in your browser to start using the system.
7. Confirm that the MongoDB connection string in **server.js** matches your Compass connection string.  
   By default, it should be:

   ```
   mongodb://localhost:27017/
   ```
